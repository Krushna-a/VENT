🚀 MERN Stack Project: VENT - Hackathons & Events Platform! 🚀



I'm thrilled to share my latest full-stack development project built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This platform serves as a centralized hub for hackathons and tech events across colleges.

🔍 Project Background



📌 While intercollege hackathons/events are frequently organized in colleges

📌 Many students miss these opportunities due to lack of centralized information

📌 Currently, updates often come only after events conclude (e.g., when HODs post victory announcements)

📌 This project aims to solve that gap by providing real-time access to upcoming opportunities



🛠 What I Built



✅ Frontend: Responsive React interface with modern UI/UX

✅ Backend: RESTful APIs with Express.js & MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)

✅ Authentication: Secure user auth via Passport.js (JWT/local strategy)

✅ Hackathons Module: Completed features for browsing/registering for hackathons

🚧 Events module in progress



💡 Technical Highlights



🔹 MVC architecture with structured controllers/services

🔹 API security best practices (input sanitization, rate limiting)

🔹 Optimized database queries for performance



This project strengthened my full-stack capabilities while addressing a practical need in Pune's student community. The code is open for review and contributions:
